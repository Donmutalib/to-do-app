# to-do-app
A To Do list application written in Django that helps users manage tasks.
Can perform basic Create Read Update and Delete operations on each task.
Handles authentication and user permissions.
It is a Docker based app and was deployed on Heroku. For the database, I created a Postgres database with Amazon RDS.
